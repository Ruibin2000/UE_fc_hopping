# UE_fc_hopping
The repo shows the sample code for UE based Rxs frequency hopping project. The project will contain two parts: ray-tracing simulation and the Reinforcement Learning. 

In the ray-tracing part, the UE model configuration file [UE2_config.py](./Ray-tracing%20Simulator/UE2_config.py) including the antenna location and rotation function, and the metal mody file [UE2.ply](./Ray-tracing%20Simulator/UE2.ply) is included. Meanwhile, the "engine" file will contain the integrated simulator env with parameters and the new defined antenna pattern by 3gpp (the class is define in file [Engine_UE2_config.py](./Ray-tracing%20Simulator/Engine_UE2_config.py)). Another jupyter notebook is uploaded as the demo main functions [test_location_engine.ipynb](./Ray-tracing%20Simulator/test_location_engine.ipynb). The results are stored in the folder "results_practical"

The route of the UE is calculated seperately in another random walk program. The random walk routes is stored as the json file in folder "routes". [test_boundary.ipynb](./Ray-tracing%20Simulator/test_boundary.ipynb) contains the code for random walk algorithm to generate the routes.
